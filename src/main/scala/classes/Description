class X(val name: String)
only getter is generated for above class
class X(private name:String)
only getter generated and is private so we can access fields by public methods inside of class

class X(var name:String)
both getter and setter are generated
class X(private var name:String)
getter and setter generated are private so we can access fields by public methods inside of class

class X(name:String)
no getter or setter generated at all but can be accessed from b.a public method from b.a class.

case class Person(name: String)
Case class constructor parameters are val by default

However its possible:-
case class x(var name:String) // var here but make no sense as case class are intended to be val for functional approaches
val d = x("abc")
d.name
d.name = "Abc"
